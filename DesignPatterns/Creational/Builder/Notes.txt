The builder design pattern involves four components to separate the construction process from its representation. They are as follows:

Abstract Builder: 
The Builder is an interface defining all the steps to make the concrete product. 

Concrete Builder: 
The Concrete Builder Classes implement the Abstract Builder interface and provide
implementation to all the abstract methods. By implementing the builder interface, the concrete builder 
is responsible for constructing and assembling the individual parts of the product.
Director: The Director takes those individual processes from the Builder and defines the sequence to build the product.

Product:
The Product is a class, and we want to create this product object using the builder design pattern.
This class defines different parts that will make the product.
