Components of Abstract Factory Design Pattern:
The Abstract Factory Design Pattern consists of the following components:

AbstractFactory: Declares an interface for operations that create abstract products.
This will be an interface for operations that will create Abstract Product objects.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ConcreteFactory: Implements the operations to create concrete product objects. These classes implement the Abstract Factory interface and provide implementations for the interface methods.
We can use these concrete classes to create concrete product objects.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AbstractProduct: Declares an interface for a type of product object. These are going to be interfaces for creating abstract products. 
Here, we need to define the Operations a Product should have.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ConcreteProduct: Implements the AbstractProduct interface. These are the classes that implement the Abstract Product interface.
Client: Uses interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes. This class will use our Abstract Factory and Abstract Product interfaces to create a family of products.
