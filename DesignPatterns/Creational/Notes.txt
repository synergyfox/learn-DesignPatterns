When to use the Creational Design Pattern in Real-Time Applications?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In case we have lots of clasess and creating lots of objects then creational dseign patterns comes in 
handy. It is used when we want to create objects in a systematic way. It is used when we want to create
objects in a way that is independent of the system.

In Real-Time Applications, the project is created with a lot of classes. A lot of classes mean we are
dealing with a lot of objects. So we need to create different objects (like new Customer(), new Product(),
new Invoice(), new Payment(), etc.) for an E-Commerce Application. If the object creation logic based on some
condition is implemented in the client code, then it leads to lots of complicated logic in the client code. 
Client code means the class that will consume the Customer Object, Product Object, Invoice Object, etc., by calling 
the methods and properties of such objects.

That means if the object creation and initialization logic are not centralized, it leads to complicated client code.
The Creational Design Pattern helps us centralize the object creation and initialization logic. Depending upon the condition,
it will create, initialize, and return the appropriate object to the client. Then, the client can consume the object by calling
the necessary methods and properties.
