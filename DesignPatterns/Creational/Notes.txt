When to use the Creational Design Pattern in Real-Time Applications?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In case we have lots of clasess and creating lots of objects then creational dseign patterns comes in 
handy. It is used when we want to create objects in a systematic way. It is used when we want to create
objects in a way that is independent of the system.

In Real-Time Applications, the project is created with a lot of classes. A lot of classes mean we are
dealing with a lot of objects. So we need to create different objects (like new Customer(), new Product(),
new Invoice(), new Payment(), etc.) for an E-Commerce Application. If the object creation logic based on some
condition is implemented in the client code, then it leads to lots of complicated logic in the client code. 
Client code means the class that will consume the Customer Object, Product Object, Invoice Object, etc., by calling 
the methods and properties of such objects.

That means if the object creation and initialization logic are not centralized, it leads to complicated client code.
The Creational Design Pattern helps us centralize the object creation and initialization logic. Depending upon the condition,
it will create, initialize, and return the appropriate object to the client. Then, the client can consume the object by calling
the necessary methods and properties. 


When to Use Singleton Design Pattern in C# Real-time Applications?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The following are some of the real-time scenarios where using the Singleton Design Pattern can be beneficial:

Shared Resources Management: For managing shared resources such as database connection pools or configuration data, where only one instance should manage the resource throughout the system.
Logging: In scenarios where an application-wide logger instance needs to capture logs from various parts of an application, ensuring that the logging mechanism is consistently used.
Caching: When you need to cache application data so it’s accessible globally and maintained within a single object, ensuring consistency.
Controlled Access and Operations: When you need to perform operations where exactly one instance is needed to coordinate actions across the system, for example, a logging class or managing access to a value shared across various parts of an application.



Advantages of Creational Design Patterns
Implementing Creational Design Patterns can lead to several benefits. They are as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Code Maintainability: By reducing dependencies on specific classes and making the system architecture more abstract, the code becomes easier to manage and extend.
Hiding the details of how objects are created: The system does not need to know the specifics about the classes initializing new objects, which promotes loose coupling.
Enhanced Scalability: Systems become more scalable as new object types can be introduced with minimal changes to the existing code.
Reduced Coupling: Patterns like Factory Method and Abstract Factory help isolate the code that constructs objects from the code that uses them, leading to lower coupling and increased flexibility.
