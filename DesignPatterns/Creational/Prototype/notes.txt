According to the GoF Definition, the Prototype Design Pattern specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance and creates new objects by copying this prototype. The Prototype Design Pattern creates objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. 

To simplify the above definition, we can say that the Prototype Design Pattern gives us a way to create new or cloned objects from the existing object of a class. That means it clones the existing object with its data into a new object. If we make any changes to the cloned object (i.e., new object), it does not affect the original object.
