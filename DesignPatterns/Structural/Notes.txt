What is the Structural Design Pattern in C#?
------------------------------------------------------
The Structural Design Patterns simplify the design by identifying a simple way to manage
the relationships between entities. They allow developers to obtain new functionalities by 
composing objects and classes. They focus on how classes inherit from each other 
and how they are composed from other classes.

When to use Structural Design Patterns in C#?
------------------------------------------------------
In real-time applications, sometimes we need to change the structure of a class or the relationship
among the classes, but we don’t want this change to be affected by the project. For example, if we have
two classes, let’s say User and Product. And the Product class is used inside the User class making one-to-many
relationships between the User and Product. Tomorrow, the structure or the relationships between these 
two classes will change. The customer now wants to keep away the Product class from the User class, as they
want to use the User and Product class independently. This is actually a structural change and we don’t want 
this structural change to affect our project. This is where the Structural Design Pattern helps us.
