The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows us to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. That means the client can access the individual objects 
or the composition of objects in a uniform manner.
 It’s useful for representing hierarchical structures such as file systems, UI components, or organizational structures
