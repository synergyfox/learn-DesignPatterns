When to use the Object Adapter Pattern and Class Adapter Pattern in C#?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is completely based on the situation. For example, if you have a Java class and want to make it
compatible with the dot net class, then you need to use the Object Adapter Design Pattern because it
is not possible to make the inheritance. On the other hand, if both the classes are within the same project and using the same
programming language, and if inheritance is possible. then you need to go for the Class Adapter Design Pattern.







When to use the Adapter Design Pattern in Real-Time Applications?
------------------------------------------------------------------


The Adapter Design Pattern in C# is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

Integration with Third-party or Legacy Systems:
When your application needs to interact with an external system or a legacy system, and the interfaces of the external systems
are not compatible with your application’s interfaces.

Reusing Existing Code: 
If you have existing classes with functionality that you need to use, but their interfaces don’t match the ones your system currently uses, an adapter can bridge this gap.
Creating a Common Interface for Different Classes: When you have several classes with different interfaces but want to treat them uniformly through a common interface.

Supporting Multiple Data Sources:.
When your application needs to handle data from different sources (like databases, file systems, web services) but wants to process them in a uniform manner.

Testing and Mocking: 
Adapters can be used to create stubs or mocks for unit testing, especially when the actual objects are cumbersome to use in a test environment (like database connections or external services).

Providing Backward Compatibility: 
When updating an application or library, adapters can be used to maintain backward compatibility with the old versions of APIs or data models.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: 
In scenarios where you need to provide support for different platforms or environments while keeping the rest of the application code consistent.
