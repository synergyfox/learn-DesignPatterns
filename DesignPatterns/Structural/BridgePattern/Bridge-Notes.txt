What is the Bridge Design Pattern in C#?
-----------------------------------------------------
As per the Gang of Four definitions, the Bridge Design Pattern Decouples 
an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
This pattern involves an interface that acts as a bridge between the abstraction 
class and implementer classes. It is useful in scenarios where an abstraction can 
have several implementations, and you want to separate the implementation details from the abstraction.


In the Bridge Design Pattern, there are 2 parts. The first part is the Abstraction,
and the second part is the Implementation. The Bridge Design Pattern allows both Abstraction
and Implementation to be developed independently, and the client code can only access the Abstraction
part without being concerned about the Implementation part.
