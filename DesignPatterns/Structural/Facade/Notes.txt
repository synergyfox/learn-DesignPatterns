What is the Facade Design Pattern in C#?
As per the GOF definition, Facade Design Pattern states that you need to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
The Facade Design Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.


Identify Complex Subsystems: First, identify the complex parts of your system that need simplification. These could be complex libraries or systems with multiple interacting classes.
Create a Facade Class: Design a facade class that provides a simple interface to the complex subsystems.

Delegate Calls to Subsystems: The facade should delegate the client requests to the appropriate objects within the subsystem. The facade should handle all the intricacies and dependencies of the subsystems.

Client Code Interaction: The client interacts with the system through the facade, simplifying its use of the complex subsystems.




When to use Facade Design Patterns in Real-Time Applications?


The Facade Design Pattern is particularly beneficial in the following scenarios:

Simplifying Complex Systems: When dealing with a complex system or framework with multiple interdependent classes or layers, you want to provide a simple interface to these systems. The Facade pattern can encapsulate this complexity behind a simple, unified interface.
Decoupling Systems: If you want to decouple a system where the components are tightly coupled or interdependent, a facade can provide loose coupling by not exposing the internal complexities to the client.
Layered Architecture: A facade can act as an entry point to each layer in multi-layered architecture. This is particularly useful in large applications or systems where each layer has complexities.
Improved Readability and Usability: When you aim to improve the readability and usability of a system. A facade can provide a clear and straightforward way to interact with a complex subsystem, making it easier for other developers to understand and use it.
Reducing Dependencies: To reduce external code dependencies on the inner workings of a library or framework, thereby shielding the client code from future changes or complexities in the subsystem.
