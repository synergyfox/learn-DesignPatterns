What is the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern?
-----------------------------------------------
According to the Gang of Four Definitions, the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern states, “Avoid coupling the sender of a
request to its receiver by giving more than one receiver object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along until an object handles it”.

The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that allows passing requests along a chain of handlers. 
Instead of sending a request directly to a specific receiver, a chain of potential receivers is formed, and each handler either processes the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain.
This pattern allows multiple objects to handle the request without coupling the sender class to the concrete classes of the receivers.

In simple words, we can say that the chain of responsibility design pattern creates a chain of receiver objects for a given request. 
In this design pattern, normally, each receiver contains a reference to the next receiver. If one receiver cannot handle the request, 
it passes the same request to the next receiver, and so on. In this case, one receiver can handle the request in the chain, or one or more receivers can handle the request.
