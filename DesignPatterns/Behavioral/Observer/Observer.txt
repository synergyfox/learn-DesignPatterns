What is the Observer Design Pattern?
-------------------------------------

According to GoF, the Observer Design Pattern Defines a one-to-many dependency between 
objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

This Design Pattern is widely used for implementing distributed event-handling systems where an 
object needs to notify other objects about its state changes without knowing who these objects are. 
In the Observer Design Pattern, an object (called a Subject) maintains a list of its dependents (called Observers). 
It notifies them automatically whenever any state changes by calling one of their methods. The Other names of 
this pattern are Producer/Consumer and Publish/Subscribe.
