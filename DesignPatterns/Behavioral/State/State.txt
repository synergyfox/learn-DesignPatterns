What is a State Design Pattern?
------------------------------------
According to Gang of Four Definitions, the State Design Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. 
In simple words, we can say that the State Design Pattern allows an object to change its behavior depending on its current internal state.
The State Design Pattern encapsulates varying behavior for the same object based on its internal state. 

This pattern is useful when an object needs to go through several states, and its behavior differs for each state. Instead of having conditional statements throughout a class to handle state-specific behaviors,
the State Design Pattern delegates this responsibility to individual state classes.


How to Implement the State Design Pattern in C#?
-------------------------------------------------
Here’s an overview of how you can implement the State Design Pattern in C#:

State Interface: This defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular context state.

Concrete State Classes: These classes implement the State interface and provide the actual behavior specific to a state.

Context: This class maintains an instance of a Concrete State subclass that defines the current state. The context delegates state-specific behavior to the current State object.

Client Code: Modifies the state of the context.



When to Use State Design Pattern in C#?
-----------------------------------------------
The State Design Pattern in C# is particularly useful in scenarios where:

Object Behavior Depends on Its State: When the behavior of an object changes depending on its internal state,
and you want to avoid large conditional statements (like switch/case or if/else) in your code. The State pattern allows you to encapsulate the behavior associated with each state in separate classes.

Complex State Logic: In cases where an object’s state has complex logic that involves many different states and transitions between those states. The State pattern helps organize this logic by separating it into distinct classes.

State-Dependent Transitions: When the rules for transitioning from one state to another are complex and need to be centralized. The State pattern allows each state object to control the transitions to other states.

Maintaining Clean Code: If you want to maintain clean code by avoiding tight coupling and minimizing the impact of changes in state logic. Each state can be managed and modified independently with the State pattern.

Large Conditional Blocks Handling: In situations where an object’s behavior includes many conditional blocks that depend on the object’s state. The State pattern allows you to remove these conditionals by encapsulating the behavior within state objects.
Runtime State Change: If the state of an object needs to change at runtime and you want the object’s behavior to change accordingly without client intervention.
Ease of Extending States and Behaviors: When you anticipate that new states might be added in the future. The State pattern makes it easier to extend states and behaviors without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.
