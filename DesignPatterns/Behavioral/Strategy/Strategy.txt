What is the Strategy Design Pattern?
-----------------------------------
According to the Gang of Four Definitions, define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, 
and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

The Strategy Design Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that enables selecting an algorithm’s behavior at runtime.
Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, run-time instructions specify which of a family of algorithms to use. 
This pattern is ideal when you need to switch between different algorithms or actions in an object dynamically. 
That means the Strategy Design Pattern is used when we have multiple algorithms (solutions) for a specific task,
and the client decides which algorithm to use at runtime.
