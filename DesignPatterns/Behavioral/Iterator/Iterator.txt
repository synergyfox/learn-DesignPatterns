What is the Iterator Design Pattern?
--------------------------------------

The Iterator Design Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that allows sequential access to the elements of an aggregate 
object (i.e., collection) without exposing its underlying representation. That means using the Iterator Design Pattern, 
we can access the elements of a collection sequentially without knowing its internal representations. 
This pattern provides a uniform interface for traversing different data structures.
