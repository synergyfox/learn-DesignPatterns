What is Mediator Design Pattern 
---------------------------------------------


According to the Gang of Four definitions, define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact with each other. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from explicitly referring to each other and letting you vary their interaction independently.

The Mediator Design Pattern reduces the communication complexity between multiple objects. This design pattern provides a mediator object, which will be responsible for handling all the communication complexities between different objects.

The Mediator Design Pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object. This pattern is used to centralize complex communications and control between related objects in a system. The Mediator object acts as the communication center for all objects. That means when an object needs to communicate with another object, it does not call the other object directly. Instead, it calls the mediator object, and it is the responsibility of the mediator object to route the message to the destination object.
